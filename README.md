# Incremental-Testing-in-Software-Product-Lines

For the evaluations of this study, we pick three SPLs: two from SPL2go [1,2] and one from SPLOT [3]. SPL2go and SPLOT are publicly available repositories of SPLs to be used for product-line analyses. We picked the SPLs in such a way that they have different numbers of features, different numbers of possible products and different numbers of testing scenarios: Bank Account (BA) SPL [1], e-Mail (eM) SPL [2] and Student Attendance System (SAS) [3]. All the features of the chosen SPLs are modeled using f-ESGs.

The experiments and results of each SPL is given on the following:\
[Bank Account SPL](https://github.com/esg4aspl/Incremental-Testing-in-Software-Product-Lines/edit/main/BankAccountSPL-IncrementalTestingData.md) [1] \
[eMail SPL](https://github.com/esg4aspl/Incremental-Testing-in-Software-Product-Lines/blob/main/eMailSPL-IncrementalTestingData.md) [2] \
[Student Attendance System SPL](https://github.com/esg4aspl/Incremental-Testing-in-Software-Product-Lines/blob/main/StudentAttedanceSystemSPL-IncrementalTestingData.md) [3] \
